# Quick start

Assuming you already downloaded ni from [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/mBdcX5) this introductory guide will help you get up to speed.

Lets get started with the location of profiles.

```
addon
└───Core
└───Settings
└───Rotation
│	└───Data
│	└───Death Knight
│	└───Druid
...
│	└───Warlock
│	└───Warrior
```

Two folders of our interest are `Data` and folder named by the class of our character. In this guide we will create a simple profile for `Warlock`. That means we are going to focus on these two folders.
