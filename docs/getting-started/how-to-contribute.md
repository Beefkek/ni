## Impementing new core features

We are trying to constatly add new features to ni, and having extra pair of hands would help.

## Creating and sharing profiles

Although it is possible convert old PQR profiles, we feel like PQR was fairly limited and as such those profiles are not utilizing ni's full potential.

Therefore we are strongly advising everyone to create profiles specficially designed for ni.
